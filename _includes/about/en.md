I am Song Zule, from Shenzhen Vocational and Technical University, born on August 1, 2003. In this world where technology and literature intersect, I am a college student passionate about both computers and the arts.

The computer world is an integral part of my lifeâ€”it's not just my academic focus but also the platform where I explore innovation and technological advancement. The logic and algorithms of programming are like a unique poem to me, where each function and variable forms the words and syntax. I enjoy every moment of coding, experiencing the pleasure of exploration and discovery.

Literature, on the other hand, is another realm deep within my soul. Immersed in the ocean of books and poetry, I am captivated by the charm of words, savoring the clash of thoughts and the flow of emotions from different writers. Literature is not only my spiritual solace but also a way to express my inner world. Through prose and poetry, I attempt to capture life's beauty and the fluctuations of emotions.

In my daily life, I enjoy exploring various video contents on platforms like Bilibili, ranging from cutting-edge technology to cultural tidbits, from programming skills to literary discussions. In online communities, I exchange technical insights and literary reflections with fellow enthusiasts, inspiring and learning from each other, collectively creating brilliance in our virtual world.

Looking ahead, I aspire to integrate the power of computers with the allure of literature to create more value and beauty for society. Let us sail in the ocean of knowledge, progress under the light of art, and together pursue a splendid journey through our shared luminous years.
